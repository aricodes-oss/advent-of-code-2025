# Advent of Code 2025

This is where I'm keeping my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) calendar! Input files are redacted of course.

## How to navigate

This repository contains numbered folders, where each number corresponds to a day in the month of December. I'll try to keep the code structure as flat as possible so it's immediately obvious where to look for the solution, but otherwise there will be a README.
